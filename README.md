Assigment for IGME 531
I tried my best to replicate the image, and while the SVG code works, I couldn't get rotate to work the way I wanted to. The rotte is rotating around a different axis than what I want it to rotate around, so i kept them in roughly the same position they were supposed to. The shapes reminded me of a plate of food in an extravagant restaurant, so i used my circle function to make a yellow "sauce" and a black plate using my ellipse function.
